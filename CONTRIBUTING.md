# Contributing to CMakePP

The following are guidelines and suggestions for contributing to CMakePP.

## Getting Started

Please see our [website](https://cmakepp.github.io/) for a brief overview of the
projects managed by the CMakePP organization.

### Asking Questions

Questions come up. We strive to have helpful documentation, but it's unlikely to
have all the answers. If you have a question, please search the documentation
and the GitHub issues for answers. If you can not find the answer then feel free
to open a GitHub issue with the question, using the "Question" template.

## Ways to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

CMakePP uses GitHub's issue feature for bug tracking. If you think you have
found a bug please first search the issues to see if it has already been
reported. If not, feel free to open a new issue using the "Bug report" template.

### Suggesting Features

We're happy to consider implementing new features. Just be aware most of us are
not directly paid to contribute to CMakePP, which means we may have other more
pressing priorities to attend to first. Like bugs, we use GitHub's issue
feature for tracking feature requests. Please do a quick search to make sure
someone else hasn't already suggested the feature before opening a new issue
using the "Feature request" template.

### Contributing Code

If you want to contribute code to a CMakePP project go ahead and open a pull
request (PR). We recommend you first create a draft PR explaining what you are
going to do. This gives the CMakePP team a chance to provide feedback and help
throughout the process. We welcome contributions to any part of our projects,
not just source code.

Please make sure your PR follows our
[coding conventions](https://cmakepp.github.io/CMakeDev/conventions/index.html).

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Since the CMakePP project is developed partly by the U.S. Department of Energy,
you will need sign a CLA for legal reasons. When you make a PR, you will
automatically be prompted to view and sign the CLA (if you have  not already).
The contents of the CLA are:

```
By contributing computer software code to the CMakePP project I certify that the
contribution is being made under the Apache 2.0 license
(https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and that I have all rights and
permissions necessary to do so, including authorization from my employer if
applicable.

NOTICE. This Software was developed under funding from the U.S. Department of
Energy and the U.S. Government consequently retains certain rights. As such, the
U.S. Government has been granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a
paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license in the Software to

```
